This package assumes it is installed into /root/backup

## Pre-use

root# aptitude install rsnapshot debsums
root# patch -Np0 -r- < ./rsnapshot.diff

## Use

- make your own versions of the files in ./examples/, and copy them here

- install ./rsnapshot.crontab with `crontab -e`
  TODO: anacrontabs would be even better!

- symlink ./archive ./current to your backup locations
  or, edit archive.conf current.conf to your backup locations
