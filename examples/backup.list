# leave this section empty; it will automatically be populated with
# config files that are modified from their original package versions

-- nonexistent_to_delete
# when backup points are removed, either manually by editing this file,
# or when dynamic generation (e.g. non_dpkg_configs) no longer produces
# them, rsnapshot will not {realise this and delete those backup points
# from the backup medium}, but instead {ignore and keep them}.
#
# this section is a practical (but not perfect) workaround against this.
# for each directory in this list, the backup medium will be cleared of
# files that no longer exist on the actual system. note that this will
# NOT clear files that {still exist, but merely are no longer set to be
# backed-up} - you'll need to manually clear those yourself.
#
# you can set this to / to clear all non-existent files, but this is
# expensive and usually unnecessary, depending on your use case.
