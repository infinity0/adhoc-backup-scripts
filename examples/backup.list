-- nonexistent_to_delete
# when backup points are changed or dynamically generated, such as when
# figuring out which config files to back up, rsnapshot will not know
# about obsolete backup points that still exist on the backup medium.
#
# for each directory in this list, the backup medium will be cleared of
# files that no longer exist on the actual system. note that this will
# NOT clear files that still exist, but merely are no longer set to be
# backed-up - you'll need to manually clear those yourself.
#
# (you can set this to / to clear all non-existent files, but this is
# expensive and may be unnecessary depending on your use case.)
